# Planties
Planties is a full-stack, RESTful Web app to collect and share your plants with other plant lovers!
It is based on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp final project (Yelpcamp). Throught this project, I learned to make a full fledged application with CRUD functionalities using a database, REST APIS, Authentication & Authorization.
